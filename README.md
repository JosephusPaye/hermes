# Hermes

> Quick generate lower-thirds that do that limbo <https://xlimbo.netlify.app>

This project is part of [#CreateWeekly](https://dev.to/josephuspaye/createweekly-create-something-new-publicly-every-week-in-2020-1nh9), my attempt to create something new publicly every week in 2020.

## Features

Hermes allows you to:

- Quickly generate lower thirds with titles and subtitles
- Automatically wrap subtitles and create new slides when the text overflows
- Download the result as a vector SVG image, which can be converted to PNG with a tool like Inkscape

## What's Next

- Expose the customisation options in the UI
- Add themes?
